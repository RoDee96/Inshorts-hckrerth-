This was an android applicattion that I developed for a HackerEarth Online contest.
It receives JSON object from web-service from the hackerearth server and then from the JSON object, more JSON objects are extracted,
and displayed in a ListView.

The application designed works for target SDK Version 19 (Android Kitkat).
To run the application, save the debug apk file onto the android deivce and then install it.

The KickStarter folder contains the Apllication source.
The structure of the project is according to android studio.
